## 🎬Movie Recommender System

This is an AIML-based Movie Recommender System that suggests similar movies based on user input. The system uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and similarity-based recommendations built with scikit-learn, and displays results interactively using Streamlit. Movie posters and metadata are fetched via the TMDb API.

### 🚀Features
